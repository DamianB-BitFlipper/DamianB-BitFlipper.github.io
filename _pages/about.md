Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am a machine learning engineer at [QuantCo](https://www.quantco.com/). Before QuantCo, I studied Computer Science and Engineering (6-3) at MIT. My computing interests focus around systems programming, software design and performance engineering.

I proudly contribute to the open-source community. Projects that I have written, open-sourced and actively maintain include [`groupstorm`](https://github.com/Quantco/groupstorm), [`algopytest`](https://github.com/DamianB-BitFlipper/algopytest) and [`conda-comply`](https://github.com/Quantco/conda-comply). I have also opened issues and written bug patches to `Pandas`, `Pyarrow` and `Eigen`.

Aside from computer science, teaching has always been important to me. All throughout university, I have taught and assisted various courses such as: graduate level Theory of Computation ([18.404](http://catalog.mit.edu/search/?P=18.404)), undergraduate level Computability and Complexity Theory ([6.045](http://catalog.mit.edu/search/?P=6.1400)), Software Performance Engineering ([6.172](http://catalog.mit.edu/search/?P=6.1060)) and Computation Structures ([6.004](http://catalog.mit.edu/search/?P=6.1910)).
